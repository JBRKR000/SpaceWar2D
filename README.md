# Spacewar2D üöÄ

## Description üéÆ

Spacewar2D is a game based on the FXGL library for creating simple games. Credits to the library can be found [here](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL).

In this game, the player assumes the role of a spaceship pilot whose objective is to defeat enemy ships. The game is developed by a single individual for hobbyist and educational purposes, aiming to enhance knowledge of the Java programming language.

**Note**: All textures, sprites, and some sound effects used in this project are borrowed from the game **AlienOutbreak 2: Invasion**. These assets are used strictly for non-commercial purposes. The project is a fan-made remake of the cult classic produced by Alawar Entertainment and is meant for learning game programming, not for commercial distribution. I do not own the rights to these assets.
